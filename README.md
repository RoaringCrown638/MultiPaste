# MultiPaste
A project to allow user to copy multiple things and choose which ones to paste
A lot of things are not set up, like how I am going to cover all laptops and OSs in this but it is a good starting point I think.

To use just download and unzip the file and choose where you would want to put the files. "MultiPasteMain.py" is the main file and "Copy.py" is the file that deals with copying multiple things to another file called "pasteList". Unfortunately I do not yet know how to make the code flexible enough to just detect which folder things are in.
In the "MultiPasteMain.bat" file in the first double quotations input where the pythonw.exe or pythonw3.9.exe is and in the second quotations input where the file "MultiPasteMain.py is. Same for the other two corresponding files for "Copy".
